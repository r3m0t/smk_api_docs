<p>
The Smarkets API is based on but not yet a subset of the <a href="http://www.fixprotocol.org/">Financial Information eXchange (FIX) Protocol</a>. The sequence field is the primary part of the FIX protocol that we decided to adopt when implementing this revision of the Smarkets API. It's purpose is to guarantee the order of messages shared between the Smarkets' server and connected clients, and by doing some allows asyncronous message passing and high throughput in both directions.

<h4>The life of a session sequence</h4>
<p>
When a connection is first made <a href="#eto/login" class="type">login</a> and <a href="#eto/login-response" class="type">login-response</a> are exhanged, each encapsulated inside an <a href="#seto/payload" class="type">seto/payload</a> and <a href="#eto/payload" class="type">eto/payload</a>. The response includes the unique <a href="#eto/session" class="type">session</a> identifier associated with the current connections incoming and outgoing sequences. The <span class="type">seq</span> for both of these <em>must</em> be <span class="seq">1</span>, this is to establish the starting point for all subsiquent payloads in this <a href="#eto/session" class="type">session</a>. Both sides of this exchange need to maintain the state of outgoing and next expected incoming sequences. In this login example the client's outgoing sequence starts at <span class="seq">1</span> and the server's expected incoming sequence is also at <span class="seq">1</span>, so when the payload is received it is correctly compared and then processed. After the payload is sent by the client it increments its outgoing sequence to <span class="seq">2</span>, and once the server correctly receives payload <span class="seq">1</span> it will increment it's expected incoming sequence to <span class="seq">2</span>.

<p>
This simple example is basically a payload and an *ack* style response, but once this initial step has taken place many incoming and outgoing payload can be sent potentially without any payload based acknowledgement. Acknowledgement is done by comparing the incoming message's sequence with the expected incoming sequence. If a process in your application performing a state transition based on an incoming payload crashes then you want to maintain that you have <em>not</em> processed that sequence number. To do this the expected next incoming sequence number should not be incremented, and when the next payload is received it will be incorrect by 1 step. To handle these cases a payload with type <a href="#eto/replay" class="type">replay</a> is sent.

<a href="#eto/session" class="type">Sessions</a> can and <em>should</em> be resumed whenever possible, and can be done via a <a href="#eto/login" class="type">login</a> payload with the <a href="#eto/session" class="type">session</a> field specifying the identifier first returned by the <a href="#eto/login-response" class="type">login-response</a> when the session was first establisted (the one with seq <span class="seq">1</span>). An example of this can be found in the documentation for <a href="#eto/login" class="type">login</a>.
