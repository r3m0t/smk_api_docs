<p>
The purpose of this payload is to expose intentional downtime of either the api connection or a subset of functionality the api provider. 
When the <a href="#eto/downtime-alert-type" class="type">eto/downtime-alert-type</a> is <span class="type">functionality</span> the 
<a href="#seto/downtime-alert" class="type">seto/downtime-alert</a> specifies which functionality that will be unavailable.
</p>
<p>
If the datetime is not defined then the downtime is expected immediately, otherwise it is expected at the specified datetime UTC.
</p>
<p>
A <span class="type">connection</span> <a href="#eto/downtime-alert-type" class="type">eto/downtime-alert-type</a> signifies the planned 
outage of all tcp connections to this api. When the downtime occurs all clients will be disconnected and expected to <em>reconnect with 
  incremental backoff time between connection attempts</em>.
</p>
<p>
A <span class="type">cancelled</span> <a href="#eto/downtime-alert-type" class="type">eto/downtime-alert-type</a> signifies that a previous
downtime-alert is no longer applicable and service should not be disrupted at the previously given datetime. datetime is always undefined
with cancelled downtime alerts.
</p>
<p>
A <span class="type">service-resumed</span> <a href="#eto/downtime-alert-type" class="type">eto/downtime-alert-type</a> signifies that 
normal service has resumed and the previous downtime-alert should now be disregarded.
</p>
<p>
The expected scheduled series of events can be any of the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Smarkets sends a downtime-alert</li>
  <li>
  At the datetime <strong>one</strong> of the following can occur:
  <ol>
    <li>If the downtime is of type <span class="type">functionality</span> and the first alert had a specific datetime 
    then  a second downtime-alert exactly like the first is sent but this time with no datetime field specific, 
    signifying the immediate downtime of the functionality specified.</li>
    <li><em>... downtime occurs ...</em></li>
    <li>A third downtime-alert is sent with type <span class="type">service-resumed</span> signifying normal service.</li>
  </ol>
  or
  <ol>
    <li>If the downtime is of type <span class="type">connection</span> all tcp connections are disconnected.</li>
    <li><em>... downtime occurs ...</em></li>
    <li>TCP acceptors are restarted and no further downtime alert is sent and service is considered resumed.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
