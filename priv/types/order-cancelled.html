This notification <a href="#message" class="type">message</a> sent to a <a href="#session" class="type">session</a> when an <a href="#order" class="type">order</a> is cancelled may occur at any time and is not restricted to being a response to an <a href="#order-cancel" class="type">order-cancel</a> <a href="#message" class="type">message</a>. Cancellation of the part of an <a href="#order" class="type">order</a> that is not yet matched also occurs when a market is halted. Cancellation of a partially matched <a href="#order" class="type">order</a> does not mean that the entire <a href="#order" class="type">order</a> was cancelled, only the <a href="#quantity" class="type">quantity</a> left is cancelled.
