If sent to Smarkets this message will result in the session being send a <a href="#market-data" class="type">market-data</a> and multiple <a href="#contract-data" class="type">contract-data</a> <a href="#payload" class="type">payloads</a>. <em>Note:</em> that these are <em>not</em> <a href="#message" class="type">messages</a> but <a href="#payload" class="type">payloads</a> themselves and are not sequenced based messages. This is to prevent them from being included in a session's historical <a href="#sequenced" class="type">sequenced</a> payload logs.
