<p>
When sending a <a href="#session" class="type">session</a> <a href="#quote" class="type">quotes</a> only a specific depth will be returned. This list will be either equal to or less than the current maximum depth Smarkets publishes over this API. Current maximum depth sent is <strong>5</strong>, but this may change in future so we urge you to ignore this number and write code to handle any size of <span class="type">quote-list</span>.
