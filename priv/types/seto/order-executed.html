When an <a href="#seto/order" class="type">order</a> created by your application's <a href="#eto/session" class="type">session</a> executes due to being fully or partially matched by another party taking the opposite position your <a href="#eto/session" class="type">session</a> will be sent a <a href="#seto/payload" class="type">seto/payload</a> with this type.

The <a href="#seto/price" class="type">price</a> here may differ from that of the original <a href="#seto/order-create" class="type">order-creation</a> due to matching at a better price.
