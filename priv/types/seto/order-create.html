You'll most probably be calling this more than anything else in this API. In response to this Smarkets will send you one of <a href="#seto/order-accepted" class="type">order-accepted</a>, <a href="#seto/order-rejected" class="type">order-rejected</a>, or <a href="#seto/order-invalid" class="type">order-invalid</a>.
</p>
<p>
To prevent your application from accidently creating more orders than it really wanted to you should always locally associate your orders within your application with the <a href="#eto/seq" class="type">seq</a> of the <a href="#eto/payload" class="type">eto/payload</a> you send to Smarkets for the current <a href="#eto/session" class="type">session</a>.
</p>
<p>
<em>If the <a href="#eto/seq" class="type">seq</a> for the <a href="#eto/payload" class="type">eto/payload</a> sent along with the <a href="#seto/payload" class="type">seto/payload</a> with type <span class="type">order-create</span> has a different outgoing <a href="#eto/seq" class="type">seq</a> number then <strong>it will result in a new order being created</strong>.</em>
