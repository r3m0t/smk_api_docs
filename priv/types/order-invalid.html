<p>
An order is validated before being sent to a <a href="#group" class="type">group</a>'s book. This will be sent in response to an <a href="#order-create" class="type">order-create</a> in the case of one or more <a href="#order-invalid-reason">order-invalid-reasons</a> being raised.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="#seq" class="type">seq</a> here refers to the <a href="#seq" class="type">seq</a> of the <a href="#sequenced" class="type">sequenced</a> <a href="#payload" class="type">payload</a> your application sent to Smarkets with the originating <a href="#order-create" class="type">order-create</a> <a href="#message" class="type">message</a> so your application can detect which request was invalid.
